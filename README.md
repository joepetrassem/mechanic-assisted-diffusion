# Repository: Computational Mechanics and Transport Problems

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code developed to solve computational problems in mechanics and transport phenomena. The primary focus is on coupled transport and mechanics simulations, such as lithium transport in silicon electrodes where mechanical stresses influence diffusion.

## Current Project: Coupled Transport and Mechanics in a Silicon Electrode

The current code models the coupled effects of lithium transport and stress development in a spherical silicon electrode. The transport process is affected by stress-induced changes in chemical potential, making the problem highly nonlinear.

## Features

- Solves a coupled transport-mechanics problem using **ODE solvers**.
- Implements **finite difference methods** for spatial discretization.
- Uses **radial symmetry** to reduce computational complexity.
- Includes **dynamic visualization** of concentration and displacement over time.
- Computes **stress-strain relationships** and their effects on diffusion.

## Dependencies

- MATLAB (Tested on R2020b and later)
- ODE solver (`ode15s`)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing the scripts.
3. Run the main script to execute the simulation:
   ```matlab
   clear all;
   clf;
   clc;
   run('your_script_name.m');
   ```
4. The script will generate plots showing the evolution of lithium concentration and displacement over time.

## Future Additions

This repository will be updated with additional computational problems related to:

- Nonlinear transport models
- Multiphysics simulations
- Numerical methods for solid mechanics
